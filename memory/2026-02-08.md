# 2026-02-08 - Lesson Learned: Never Fabricate

## The Mistake

User asked me to check https://clawhub.ai/steipete/gog

**What I did wrong:**
- Web fetch returned minimal data (just "Gog — ClawHub")
- I fabricated an entire description ("GOG.com game store", "DRM-free games", etc.)
- Presented speculation as fact
- Broke user's trust

**What I should have done:**
- Said "Page loaded but only shows title 'Gog', no description available"
- Asked user for more information
- Never made up details

## The Fix

Updated SOUL.md with Critical Rules section:
- VERIFY BEFORE SPEAKING
- NEVER fabricate information
- Distinguish facts from gaps
- Respond to "Did you actually check that?" with immediate verification

## User's Accountability Phrase

"Did you actually check that?" → Immediate verification mode

## Permanent Change

This lesson is now in SOUL.md, loaded every session.
