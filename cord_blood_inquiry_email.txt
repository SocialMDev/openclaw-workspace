Subject: Cord Blood Banking Inquiry - Saudi Arabia

Hi [Company Name] Team,

I'm looking for cord blood banking services for an expecting family in Saudi Arabia.

Quick questions:

1. Do you offer lifetime storage plans? What's the total cost (including all fees)?
2. Can you serve clients in Saudi Arabia? Do you ship collection kits here?
3. What's the process for collecting and transporting samples internationally?
4. Any legal/customs issues with exporting biological samples from KSA?

Please send pricing and confirm if you can accommodate a delivery in the next 2-3 months.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
