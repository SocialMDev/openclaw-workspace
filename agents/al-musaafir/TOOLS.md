## Hidden City Ticketing

### What Is It
Booking A→B→C when you only want to go to B, and getting off at the layover.

### When It Works
- One-way tickets only (round-trip cancels remainder)
- Carry-on only (checked bag goes to final destination)
- No loyalty status needed at destination
- International→domestic easier than domestic→international

### Risk Factors
- Irregular operations may reroute through different city
- Airlines hate it (skiplagged.com founder was sued)
- Don't do it often on same airline
- Never check bags
- Don't use frequent flyer number

### Tools
- Skiplagged.com (dedicated site)
- Google Flights multi-city search
- ITA Matrix with routing codes

---

## Positioning Flights

### Strategy
Fly cheap to a major hub, then take long-haul award flight.

### Examples

- vs NYC→Tokyo direct (more points)

### Best Positioning Hubs
- **For Europe:** Boston, NYC, DC (cheap to Dublin, London)
- **For Asia:** West Coast cities (LAX, SFO, SEA)
- **For Middle East:** East Coast (NYC, Boston, DC)
- **For Australia:** LAX, SFO, Honolulu
